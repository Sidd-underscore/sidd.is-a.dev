Welcome to my personal website.

### Contributing
**I AM NOT ACCEPTING CONTRIBUTIONS TO MY WEBSITE.** After all, it's my profile. It doesn't represent *me* if other people have written the code. However, feel free to correct my spelling :D

### About

This website is static and works just fine on GitHub pages and with Jekyll.
