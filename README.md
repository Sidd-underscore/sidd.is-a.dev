Welcome to my personal website.

### Contributing
**I AM NOT ACCEPTING CONTRIBUTIONS TO MY WEBSITE.** After all, it's my profile. It doesn't represent *me* if other people have written the code. However, feel free to check out my code!

### About
This website was partially made using Bootstrap. FYI.

### Run your own instance
Want to run this locally?

```txt
git clone https://github.com/uh-Sid/camthehelpdesk.github.io.git
```

Then, just open `index.html` in your facorite browser to run it.

You can edit the quotes starting on line 19 of `assets/js/quote.js`. Everything else can be editeded in `index.html`.

This website is static and works just fine on GitHub pages and with Jekyll.
